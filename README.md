# Project Feedback System API

**The project based on the content from "README file" to construct a new project following the principles and learnings outlined in the document**

- Below is a structured approach to start a new project from scratch using the knowledge i have as a beginner.

**Project Structure Commands**

- Command sequence to set up the project structure:

**Create the root project folder**

```bash
mkdir feedback-system
cd feedback-system
```

**Initialize the project**
`npm init -y`

**Install dependencies**
`npm install express mongoose`

**Create subdirectories**
`mkdir models routes controllers config utils`

**Create core files**
`touch server.js models/Feedback.js routes/feedback.js controllers/feedbackController.js config/db.js utils/helpers.js`

**Optional: Add a README file**
`touch README.md`

#### Project Structure

```lua
feedback-system/
├── server.js
├── models/
│ └── Feedback.js
├── routes/
│ └── feedback.js
├── controllers/
│ └── feedbackController.js
├── config/
│ └── db.js
├── utils/
│ └── helpers.js
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## The main branch is uploaded as a template for a clean starting point.

- The goal is to keep the main branch stable to experiment for the feature additions. This approach promotes organized development and collaboration (if needed) a clean sheet!

## BE - Mongoose - MVC

- study case and theory
  **Btw**
- Here’s a guide to creating a GitHub repository from your terminal in VS Code, complete with setting up a .gitignore file, adding your README.md, and making your initial commit.

**1. Create .gitignore file**

`touch .gitignore`

- Add whatever you don't want to upload. Maybe entries for node.js?
- node_modules/
- .env
- .DS_Store
- npm-debug.log

**2. Initiate git**
`git init`

**3. Add README.md**

- description and project details. "What are you doing?"

**4. Add all**
`git add .`

**5. Commit Your Change**
`git commit -m "Initial commit: Project setup"`

**6. Add the remote Repository**
`git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/feedback-system.git`

**7. Push your project to github**
`git branch -M main`
`git push -u origin main`

**8. Branch out to practice**
`git checkout -b feature-branch-name`

**9. add and commit the changes as often as you like**

- follow the add and commit steps above.

**10. Push your branch when you are done**
`git push -u origin feature-branch-name`

## Recap

- MongoDB Atlas
  - Connection to Compass
  - Connection to MongoShell

## Agenda

- Theory: MVC, ODM/ORM
- Using MongoDB from Node with Mongoose

## Theory

### MVC

- A classic and very common architectual pattern is called _MVC_
  - Model, View, Controller
- **Model** represents the data of an application
- **View** represents the user interface
- **Controller** handles interaction between views and models
- In a purely REST API backend, we don't really have the _View_ at all
- Let's think of an example
  - We have an application with a feedback form
  - Logged in users can submit feedback form
  - Admin users can log in, view and delete feedback forms (spam)
  - Admins can also create, list, update and delete users
  - Endpoints:
    - `GET /feedback` - requires admin login
    - `POST /feedback` - requires admin or normal user login
    - `DELETE /feedback/:id` - requires admin login
    - `GET /user` - requires admin login
    - `POST /user` - requires admin login to create users
    - `POST /user/login` - allows users to login
    - `PATCH /user/:id` - requires admin login
    - `DELETE /user/:id` - requires admin login
  - Here we have 2 main concepts: `Feedback` and `User`
  - You would probably want an express router for Feedback and User as well.
  - With MVC
    - `Feedback` and `User` are the Models
    - `FeedbackRouter` and `UserRouter` are the Controllers
      - sometime the endpoint functions are called the controllers instead
      - MVC is conceptual, not a tight terminology
    - The `Feedback` and `User` would probably be stored in a Database

### ODM / ORM

- It's very common to use a library to work with databases
- This can make coding easier and code nicer to read
- One way common data libraries work is called ODM or ORM
  - _Object Document Mapping_ (we will focus on this)
  - _Object Relational Mapping_
- **In MongoDB, these libraries "map" a `collection` to a `Model`**
- A model is basically like a JavaScript class
  - Instead of doing `db.feedbacks.find()`
  - You would do `Feedback.find()`
- Concepts like an ODM are a great example of "layers of abstraction"
  - They allow a programmer to focus on less at a time
  - Instead of having to think of database/collection/document
  - You can just _think of the concepts_ and the _details are abstracted_ away
- The biggest ODM for MongoDB is called _Mongoose_
  - Mongoose is an ODM, it maps `Collections` to `Models`

## Mongoose Setup and Basic Usage

**Installing Mongoose**

- To use Mongoose, install it via your terminal using npm. `npm install mongoose`

**Connecting to MongoDB Atlas**

- To connect to your MongoDB Atlas database, use `mongoose.connect()` with your database URI.
  _Example:_
  `js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('your-connection-string', {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true
}).then(()=> console.log('Connected to MongoDB'))
.catch(err => console.error('Connection error', err));
`

**Listening to Mongoose Connection Events**

- Mongoose provides several connection events that you can listen to for debugging and monitoring purposes.

  - _connected_: This event is fired when Mongoose successfully connects to the database.
  - _error_: This event is fired if there is an error while connecting.
    _Example_

  ```js
  mongoose.connection.on("connected", () => {
    console.log("Mongoose connected to DB");
  });

  mongoose.connection.on("error", (err) => {
    console.error("Mongoose connection error:", err);
  });
  ```

```

```

### Models and Schemas

- Organize your project by creating a `models` folder.
- To use Mongoose, we have to define the _shape of our data_

  - Kind of defining a _blueprint of the data_
  - In other words; what does our data look like

  ```js
  // Basic object example
  const user = {
      _id: "123",
      email: "samy@example.org",
      password: "qwerty123",
      accountNumber: 8675309,
      description: "but most of all, Samy is my hero"
      isVerified: true,
  }

  // The shape of or data might be like this
  {
      _id             // String, cannot be empty
      email           // String, cannot be empty
      password        // String, cannot be empty
      accountNumber   // Integer, cannot be empty
      description     // String, can also be empty/null
      isVerified      // Boolean, false by default until account is verified
  }
  ```

- A schema defines the structure of the documents in a collection
  - Example:
    ```js
    const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
      name: String,
      price: Number,
      inStock: Boolean,
    });
    ```

### Models

- A model is a wrapper for the schema. It provides an interface to the database:
  - Example:
    ```js
    const Product = mongoose.model("Product", productSchema);
    ```

### Creating Documents

- To create a new document in the database, use `Product.create()`. This is an asynchronous operation.

  - Example:
    ```js
    const newProduct = await Product.create({
      name: "Sample Product",
      price: 10.99,
      inStock: true,
    });
    console.log(newProduct);
    ```

### Finding Documents

- To find documents in the database, use `Product.find()`. This is also an asynchronous operation.

  - Example:
    ```js
    const products = await Product.find({ inStock: true });
    console.log(products);
    ```

## Wrap-up

- MVC is a software architecture pattern
- stands for Model View Controller
- Mongoose is a MongoDB ODM
- Object-Document Mapper
- Mongoose has Schemas to define the shape of our data
- Mongoose Schemas create Mongoose Models
- Mongoose Models are used to control objects
